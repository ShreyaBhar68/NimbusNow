            <div class="faq">
                <h3>How do I search for a city's weather?</h3>
                <p>Simply type the name of the city or zip code into the search bar on the homepage and click the <strong>Search</strong> button. You'll receive an instant, magical weather update for that location!</p>

                <h3>What does the hourly forecast show?</h3>
                <p>The hourly forecast provides temperature, weather conditions, and the chance of rain for each hour of the day, allowing you to plan your day with a mystical precision.</p>

                <h3>How do I switch between metric and imperial units?</h3>
                <p>You can easily toggle between metric (°C, km/h) and imperial (°F, mph) units by using the dropdown menu located next to the search bar. NimbusNow will adjust the units instantly!</p>

                <h3>How can I view more of the hourly forecast?</h3>
                <p>If the hourly forecast is too long, you’ll see a <strong>View More</strong> button at the bottom of the list. Click it to reveal the hidden hours, and click again to collapse the view.</p>

                <h3>Why isn't the map displaying?</h3>
                <p>If the weather map isn't showing, make sure you have an active internet connection and that the map’s resources are loading correctly. You can also try refreshing the page.</p>
